# Tree Detection and Height From Shadow visalization demo
This repository contains the demo for visualizing the tree height detection output from the [Tree Detection and Height From Shadow](https://marketplace.up42.com/block/1e482528-6777-4895-a5c0-4433cfe8f9da) processing block in UP42. 

For a quick demo on how to use the UP42 python libraries to create workflow and run the tree height processing block, please visit the original repository: [infrastructure-webinar-demo](https://github.com/thaisbendixen/infrastructure-webinar-demo)

# Tree height detection use case
Railway operators must ensure secure uninterrupted transport. To achieve this they rely on effective monitoring and maintenance of their railway network. Tree falls onto railway tracks or overhead lines rank among the most common causes of disruptions of a natural origin [[BÃ­l et. al (2017)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318816940_Identifying_locations_along_railway_networks_with_the_highest_tree_fall_hazard)]. Thus, there is a need for regular inspections of vegetation inside and near the railway corridors to detect trees or tree branches that need to be cut. With UP42 you are able to get information on tree height using high resolution satellite imagery, for example [Pleiades](https://marketplace.up42.com/block/18d09f1a-3197-4c27-a15a-54d099c31435) or [SPOT](https://marketplace.up42.com/block/045019bb-06fc-4fa1-b703-318725b4d8af) data, in combination with the spacept  [SPOT](https://marketplace.up42.com/block/045019bb-06fc-4fa1-b703-318725b4d8af) block.
